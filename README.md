This is a sample app built in IOS as a template for a chatbot conversation app.

Code has been compiled to **Swift 5**.

Code compatible with **Xcode 11.0** and **IOS 13.2** for both **IPhone** and **IPad**.


## Welcome Screen

Since it's only a sample app, its design is purely functional. Tap anywhere to move to the chat window.

## Using the app

Chat screen is not optimized for the new UI layout - so it's not perfect.

It contains an upload image on the left side. that can be seen in the chat after upload.

It can be connected to any API that returns a response and create your own chatbot experience.
